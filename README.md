# üî† Lingorise: My Journey of Android Learning

**Lingorise** began as a simple project called **Vocabuilder**, aimed at helping users learn English words effectively through flashcards, quiz games, and fill-in-the-blank exercises. Over time, it evolved into a comprehensive language-learning solution, marking a significant milestone in my journey as an Android developer.

# üåç A Journey to Remember
Lingorise represents more than just an app; it reflects my journey in learning Android development. From starting with **Java** to transitioning into **Kotlin** and from **XML layouts** to mastering **Jetpack Compose**, this project has been my cornerstone for growth.

In 2023, upon moving to the UK, I decided to temporarily discontinue the project for personal reasons. However, I‚Äôve made all repositories public as a testament to this journey and as inspiration for anyone embarking on their own Android development path.

## üöÄ The Evolution

### **Vocabuilder**
- **Initial Idea:** Add 5 English words with meanings and examples, and the app generates flashcards and quizzes to aid learning.
- **Features Developed:**
  - Flashcards for memorization.
  - Quiz games for testing knowledge.
  - Fill-in-the-blank exercises for practical application.

### Transition to **Lingorise**
- The project expanded beyond vocabulary building to become a one-stop solution for language learning, incorporating:
  - **Short-form Courses**: Structured lessons for effective learning.
  - **Progress Tracking**: Monitor learning milestones.
  - **Learning Bot**: AI-powered guidance.
  - **Social Learning**: Learn with friends in real-time.

## üìö Modules Developed

### 1. **Quizer**
- A library module that dynamically generates quizzes for various learning scenarios.
- This library is public on my old GitHub account with releases available for use. However, it is **not maintained**, and I have no intention to update it in the future. [Access Quizer on GitHub](https://github.com/nhmkSAIFULLAH/GameBox)

### 2. **ClickWordLibrary**
- Enables real-time word-click detection in a paragraph using a `TextView`. Perfect for blog posts where users can instantly check word meanings.
- This library is also public on my old GitHub account with releases available for use. Similar to Quizer, it is **not maintained**, and there are no plans for updates. [Access ClickWordLibrary on GitHub](https://github.com/nhmkSAIFULLAH/ClickWordLibrary).
